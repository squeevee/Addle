# Interfaces guide

Addle's extensive use of interfaces is one of the more unusual aspects of its
design compared to other Qt projects I've encountered. I anticipate the need for 
some explanation of how they work and how to use them.

Essentially, in Addle certain classes have separated interfaces and 
implementations. Interfaces refer to pure abstract classes defined in
"src/common/interfaces", and the implementations are located variously in
"src/core" etc. An implementation may refer to itself but other code should only
refer to the interface.

For context see the "Dependency inversion" section of [Overview](./Overview.md).

The first thing to note is that the separation of interface and implementation
is only required for *some* classes.

**Yes, only use the interface:**

- "Domain classes": any class that is primarily responsible for some
functionality and/or state that is significant to Addle's domain. This includes 
all Models, Presenters and Services, though exception is given to some Views
(see the "Views" section below).
- Helper interfaces: some domain interfaces define one or more secondary 
interfaces that provide additional data or facilitate special communication.
For example, users of `IViewPortPresenter` can acquire a reference to an
`IViewPortPresenter::IScrollState` object that aggregates the state the
viewport's current scroll position. Or users of `ISizeSelectionPresenter` can
(optionally) make their own implementation of
`ISizeSelectionPresenter::ISizeIconProvider` and use it to provide the presenter
with data about icons.

**No, refer to the class directly:**

- Classes that hold data but only perform a trivial amount of logic. For
example: Model Builders, `ImportExportInfo`, exceptions.
- "Utility classes", including ones that perform a non-trivial amount of logic, 
but do so within a generic or highly reusable context. These must not depend on
any implementations. For example: `PresetMap`.
- "Helper classes" that are owned and used by implementations to perform a 
reusable or relativley segregated task. These may perform domain functionality, 
and own domain state on behalf of an implementation. These must not depend on
any implementation. For example: `DocumentLayersHelper` (used by 
`DocumentPresenter`).
- Classes provided by STL, Qt, or Boost (most of which fall under one of the
first two camps).
- Classes and structs whose creation or access are in performance-critical
scenarios. (These should probably fall into one of the first two camps anyway).
- Most UI components (again see the "Views" section below).

## ServiceLocator

The service locator pattern, provided in the global class `ServiceLocator`,
is used to acquire instances of desired interface types. The name refers to its
ability to acquire (locate) "Services", which are singleton-like objects that
provide some global functionality or own global state.

```c++
#include "servicelocator.hpp"

// concrete reference
Freem::instance().serviceMethod();

// interface reference
ServiceLocator::get<IFreem>().serviceMethod();
```

In Addle, the `ServiceLocator` is combined with a generic Abstract Factory, and
can be used to construct new objects of various interface types.

```c++
#include "servicelocator.hpp"

// concrete reference
Spiff* spiff = new Spiff();

// interface reference
ISpiff* spiff = ServiceLocator::make<ISpiff>();
```

Service locator is configured at the beginning of runtime to map interface types
to implementation factories. Only *it* needs to know about these mappings, the
rest of the code can just go about using the interfaces.

The interfaces which are allowed to be "gotten" or "made" are marked with
respective traits ("interfaces/traits.hpp"). You will see the macro
`DECL_MAKEABLE` in the header that defines the interface if it is meant for use
with `ServiceLocator::make<...>()`, and `DECL_SERVICE` or
`DECL_PERSISTENT_OBJECT_TYPE` if it is meant for use with
`ServiceLocator::get<...>()`

Some publicly makeable interfaces need to be initialized with some data,
analogous to calling a constructor with arguments. Such an interface exposes one
or more functions called `initialize`. `ServiceLocator` automatically calls
`initialize` if it is present, passing in the given arguments.

```c++
ISpiff* spiff = ServiceLocator::make<ISpiff>(QString("Hello world"), 99);

// is semantically equivalent to
Spiff* spiff = new Spiff(QString("Hello world"), 99);

// and more strictly equivalent to
ISpiff* spiff = new Spiff();
spiff->initialize(QString("Hello world"), 99);
```

Doing any operation on such an object before it has been initialized is
undefined behavior. Classes implementing interfaces that expect initialization
can use `InitializeHelper` to ensure correct initialization at runtime.

Note that due to C++ arugment type inference rules, if an initialize function
has an argument with a non-const l-value reference type, you will need to wrap
that argument in `std::ref()` when calling `ServiceLocator::make()`.

```c++
ISpiff* spiff = ServiceLocator::make<ISpiff>(std::ref(*_freem));
```

Also note that you will need to `#include` the header that defines the desired 
interface before calling a `ServiceLocator` function on it. Calling
`ServiceLocator` functions on an incomplete type results in build errors.

## AddleId

Instances of `AddleId` can be used in conjunction with `ServiceLocator` to
differentiate between multiple implementations of the same interface.

For example a derived type of AddleId might be `FruitId` for which some
instances are globally defined. If `IFruit` is marked with the macro
`_TYPE_(IFruit, FruitId)` then it can be gotten by instances of
`FruitId`.

```c++
namespace Fruits
{
    constexpr FruitId PeachId = 0x998;
    constexpr FruitId PearId  = 0x999;
}

IFruit& peach = ServiceLocator::get<IFruit>(Fruits::PeachId);
IFruit& pear = ServiceLocator::get<IFruit>(Fruits::PearId);
```

Peach and Pear might have totally different implementations, or they might be
the same class with different initialized values.

## Interfaces implemented as QObject

For some interfaces, in addition to pure virtual methods, it is desirable to 
also expose access to `QObject` features, such as signals, slots, and
properties. It is not possible to virtually or multiply inherit `QObject` so
rather than interfaces directly deriving from `QObject`, they derive from a
special interface called `IAmQObject`, which promises that the implementation
will be derived from `QObject`.

In order to access the `QObject`, call `qobject_interface_cast` on the interface
object. Or use the convenience wrapper `connect_interface` to connect signals
or slots to an interface. The trait `Traits::implemented_as_QObject` will be true
for interfaces deriving from `IAmQObject`.

Interfaces deriving `IAmQObject` should also register themselves with Qt using
the `Q_DECLARE_INTERFACE` macro. Addle interfaces are identified with the D-Bus
style namespace "org.addle.\<interface name\>".

```c++
namespace Addle {

class ISpiff : public virtual IAmQObject
{
public:
    virtual ~ISpiff() = default;

    //...
};

} // namespace Addle

Q_DECLARE_INTERFACE(Addle::ISpiff, "org.addle.ISpiff")
```

A class implementing an `IAmQObject` interface should list the interface in the
`Q_INTERFACES` macro of its definition. It should also use the convenience macro
`IAMQOBJECT_IMPL` to provide `IAmQObject` functions.

```c++
namespace Addle {

class ADDLE_EXPORT_CORE Spiff : public QObject, public ISpiff
{
    Q_OBJECT
    Q_INTERFACES(Addle::ISpiff)
    IAMQOBJECT_IMPL
public:
    virtual ~Spiff() = default;

    //...
};

} // namespace Addle
```

For an interface, the `signals:` and `public slots:` labels are technically
meaningless and not processed by MOC -- but the pure virtual methods given under
them are hints of corresponding (overriding) methods in the implementation that
will be recognized by the Meta Object system using the same signature.

Note: signals and slots on an interface can only be connected by string and not
by functor. Errors in the signature will not be caught by the compiler.

Some interfaces -- mainly Presenters -- also expose a set of QObject Properties,
the names of which are accessible as the members of
`<interface name>::Meta::Properties`, and are declared using the macros 
`DECL_INTERFACE_META_PROPERTIES`, etc. This is a correctness-assuring
convenience for things like property bindings that operate on properties by
name. Regular getters and setters should be exposed by the interface and used in
all other contexts. 

## Factory filters

A new (October 2020) feature implemented in Addle allows ServiceLocator to
choose factories at runtime based on the arguments passed to `make`.

An example of the motivating case for this feature:

```c++

// Interfaces

class ISpiffPresenter : ... { ... };

class IRedSpiffPresenter : public ISpiffPresenter { ... };
class IBlueSpiffPresenter : public ISpiffPresenter { ... };

class ISpiffView : ...
{
public:
    virtual void initialize(ISpiffPresenter&) = 0;
    ...
};

// Implementations

class RedSpiffView : ..., public ISpiffView { ... };
class BlueSpiffView : ..., public ISpiffView { ... };

// Service configuration

{
    config->addAutoFactory<ISpiffView, RedSpiffView>(
        ServiceConfig::Filter()
            .byArg<IRedSpiffPresenter>()
    );

    config->addAutoFactory<ISpiffView, BlueSpiffView>(
        ServiceConfig::Filter()
            .byArg<IBlueSpiffPresenter>()
    );
}

// Use case

void makeSpiffView(ISpiffPresenter& presenter)
{
    ISpiffView* view = ServiceLocator::make<ISpiffView>(presenter);
    ...
}

```

Here, `makeSpiffView` will make a `RedSpiffView` or a `BlueSpiffView` depending
on whether `presenter` is red or blue respectively. However, `makeSpiffView` is
not required to know the full mapping of specialized presenters to views -- all
of that is offloaded onto the configuration of the ServiceLocator, i.e., the
expert of mapping interfaces and implementations for a given module.

A factory filter can also be given a predicate for a given argument to select 
based on the argument's value or properties.

```c++
{
    config->addAutoFactory<ISpiffView, CeruleanSpiffView>(
        ServiceConfig::Filter()
            .byArg<IBlueSpiffPresenter>([](const IBlueSpiffPresenter& p) -> bool {
                return p.isCerulean();
            })
    );
}
```

Any number of arguments can be filtered for. Similar predicates can also be put 
on the AddleId used by ServiceLocator when making a persistent object.

This pattern somewhat resembles dependency injection and seems to have similar
advantages in the way it allows for complex decoupled code. I'm not married to
it in its current incarnation (it has a bit of design smell in my opinion), but
it's at least the start of something exciting.

## Views

(In light of the new factory filters feature, Views may become less of a special
case in the future.)

See the "Model-Presenter-View" section of [Overview](./Overview.md).

Views are the major exception to the practice of only referring to domain
classes by interfaces and not implementations. Most Views are implemented as
component objects in some GUI framework -- i.e., (September 2020) `QWidget`s and
`QGraphicsItem`s (and possibly more in the future). The respective APIs require
access to objects of these component types in order to function. Creating
interfaces that are abstract and flexible, but also efficiently interoperate
with the necessary framework(s) without introducing bugs, rapidly becomes far
too complex to be worth the trouble.

The few Views that need to be exposed to non-View classes, e.g., MainEditorView 
which is created by its presenter, have proper interfaces for the purposes of
being accessed from other modules. Beyond this, Views are responsible for
creating each other and providing each other with access to respective 
Presenters. And thus the rest of Addle doesn't even need to know what Views
exist or what they do.

This is a less strict interpretation of dependency inversion, but will hopefully
be sufficient for our purposes.
